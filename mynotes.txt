I will start adding notes here as I go in the project, important things I don't wanna miss the next time. Just for reference!!

Created the project through npx create-next-app project-name --use-npm

Added babelrc and modified eslintrc so there wouldn't show an error in _app.js (the project still compiled fine, but vsc said there was an error)

Image component! Look up more on it

Strapi. Installed yarn globally and @strapi/design-system in the project reference https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/11729. My node is v14. Custom install, default db mongo. Remember the db is the one provided by mongo atlas. Connect - connect your application - mongodb+srv://gabisanto:<password>@//COPY FROM HERE//cluster0.dekmlih.mongodb.net//TO HERE///?retryWrites=true&w=majority Followed instructions after install, using yarn develop.

Installed mongodb compass. New connection, copy paste the connection string from mongo REMEMBER TO ADD THE PASSWORD

In strapi, set find and findone to public under settings so the content is available for people to see.

Open an account in cloudinary to upload all content and npm i strapi-provider-upload-cloudinary

Add in next.config.js
images: {
    domains: ["res.cloudinary.com"],
  }

env.local when in server side you can name it however you want but for client side, it's line 2 (NEXT_PUBLIC_ETC)
