I will start adding notes here as I go in the project, important things I don't wanna miss the next time. Just for reference!!

Created the project through npx create-next-app project-name --use-npm

Added babelrc and modified eslintrc so there wouldn't show an error in _app.js (the project still compiled fine, but vsc said there was an error)
