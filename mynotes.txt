I will start adding notes here as I go in the project, important things I don't wanna miss the next time. Just for reference!!

Created the project through npx create-next-app project-name --use-npm

Added babelrc and modified eslintrc so there wouldn't show an error in _app.js (the project still compiled fine, but vsc said there was an error)

Image component! Look up more on it. Solution to irregular image sizing
<Image layout="responsive" width='100%' height='100%' objectFit='contain' src={image.url} alt={`Image for entry "${title}"`}/>
Reference https://dev.to/tanahmed/next-image-make-image-fill-available-space-272o comment section. This worked but not so well because it did funky things to the container.
HOWEVER always go to documentation! Since I was already importing the image element in the api, I can make the height and width dynamic!
 width={image.width} height={image.height} let's goo

Strapi. Installed yarn globally and @strapi/design-system in the project reference https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/11729. My node is v14. Custom install, default db mongo. Remember the db is the one provided by mongo atlas. Connect - connect your application - mongodb+srv://gabisanto:<password>@//COPY FROM HERE//cluster0.dekmlih.mongodb.net//TO HERE///?retryWrites=true&w=majority Followed instructions after install, using yarn develop.

Installed mongodb compass. New connection, copy paste the connection string from mongo REMEMBER TO ADD THE PASSWORD

In strapi, set find and findone to public under settings so the content is available for people to see.

Open an account in cloudinary to upload all content and npm i strapi-provider-upload-cloudinary

Add in next.config.js
images: {
    domains: ["res.cloudinary.com"],
  }

env.local when in server side you can name it however you want but for client side, it's line 2 (NEXT_PUBLIC_ETC)

npm run dev
yarn develop
mongo db compass remember to update ip if rebooting or disconnecting

requests to apis through getServerSide etc ONLY in pages IT DOESN'T WORK in components

STRAPI doesn't accept "Equipment" as valid content type??? After much frustration and thinking I was doing something wrong, a quick google search for the error shown, brought back a stackoverflow post (with no replies) where OP mentioned having trouble creating an "equipment" content type. So i tried with gear and it worked perfectly. Very strange? Reference https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69895288/status-400-bad-request-when-creating-content-type-in-strapi People have reported issues with content type starting with numbers, however "Equipment" is a regular string?

UPDATE: upon further research it seems like it's a models name issue. Strapi needs words that have plural form for the models which does make sense and I hadn't thought of somehow. Equipment is indeed a noun without a plural form so it would naturally be forbidden. However Gear is also a wrong noun for this since the plural form gears means something else. So I called it Item and moved on. Reference https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/1198
