# Welcome to Under The Sea

This is a **REACT** project, this time using **NextJS**, **Strapi**, and **Mongo** to build it up. It has a **blog section** and an **online shop** with my first **functional cart**! Woot! It took blood, sweat, and tears of frustration (and much googling!) but looking at your finished site is always a great feeling.

Why a SCUBA diving shop? Well, I'm a SCUBA diver of course! Much like coding, diving requires patience, constant training, and always relying on your peers. From a humble pool to open sea, diving is always surprising, always full of excitement. When I thought about a possible e-commerce to practice and learn new sides to REACT, it was always first within my options. It's very comforting to see these 2 passions cross paths in a made up but functional project! ‚öõÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏èü§ø
